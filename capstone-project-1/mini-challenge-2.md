# Mini-Challenge 2: Intro to Testing

## Answer the following questions first
1. Using `create-react-app`, what do we need to set up for testing?
2. What components are worth to test in your development?
3. Can you apply TDD once you already created components?

## The Challenge

> **NOTE:* Apply TDD as much as you can.*

1. Find any sub-routine, extract that logic into a separate file and test it out.
2. Run test coverage and save results into a .txt file at ./ - root level. Can you make the total coverage to be above of 60%?

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Meaningful test cases were implemented for components and sub-routines logic.
- [ ] All the test cases were successful.

## Bonus Points
- [ ] Test coverage is above 60%.
