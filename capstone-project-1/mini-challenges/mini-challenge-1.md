# Mini-Challenge 1: Core Concepts and Styling

## Before you start:
1. Read carefully [the instructions for the project](https://github.com/wizelineacademy/react-gist/blob/main/capstone-project-1/apprenticeship/README.md), please make sure that you clearly understand all the requirements.
2. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/wizelineacademy/react-apprenticeship-capstone1). Please make sure that your new repo is publicly accesible.

> **NOTE:* You should use the provided codebase only as a guide for structuring your application. Feel free to add, remove, or change anything if you consider it necessary.*

## The challenge:
1. Create the UI layout for your app, it should include the following elements:
  - 1.1 Header: Similar to the one in our [demo app](https://react-certification-2020.netlify.app/). For now, the search field, theme toggle, login button, and other navigation links should be disabled, i.e., you only need to create the corresponding UI elements without the functionality.
  - 1.2 Content: The content view corresponding to the section that will be renderered (in this case, the Home View).
2. Create the **Home View** and display the list of items from [this mock file](https://github.com/wizelineacademy/react-gist/blob/main/capstone-project-1/mocks/youtube-videos-mock.json).
3. Apply css styles to your components using the [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) approach.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] The header is rendered correctly.
- [x] A list of videos obtained from a mock file is displayed in the **Home View**.
- [x] CSS styles are applied correctly using the styled-components approach.

## Bonus Points
- [ ] No warnings or errors are logged in the browser console.
- [ ] The UI is responsive
